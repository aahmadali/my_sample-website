            Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach the
            world <em>technical sophistication</em>, which includes both "hard
            skills" like coding, command lines, and version control, and "soft
             skills" like guessing keyboard shortcuts, Googling error messages, and
            knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.

            benefit from learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join
